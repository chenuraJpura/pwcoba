<h3>Sir Charles Henry De Soysa</h3>
<p style="float: left;margin-right: 5px;"><img wpfc-lazyload-disable="true" class="size-medium wp-image-21 alignleft" src="images/founder.gif" alt="" width="203" height="300"></p>
<p>Charles Henry de Soysa was born on March 3rd 1836.</p>
<p>He was the only son of Mudliyar Jeronis de Soysa and Mututantrige Francesca Cooray. The baby girl born to them died 11 months after her birth.</p>
<p>With his background it was natural for Charles Henry, the sole heir to the vast property of his father who was bestowed the title of Mudliyar of the Gate for his social welfare activities to continue the unfinished services of his father.</p>
<p>The Holy Emmanuel Church in Idama, Moratuwa was constructed by the father at the request of the pastor of the church and was completed by the son. His baby sister died in her infancy and Charles who became the owner of his father’s assets further enhanced his wealth by acquiring the massive wealth bequeathed to him by his paternal uncle Susew who died without issue.</p>
<p>He was taken to Hanguranketa by his father to acquaint him with agricultural activities. He rode on horseback supervising the work on the estates and was known for his numerous acts of charity and kindness which qualities endeared him to his employees. He was known as ‘Punchi Mahattaya’ in the estates and although his only income then was a small stipend his father gave him, more as ‘pocket money’ than an allowance, he spent even that money on the welfare of the needy.</p>
<p>He was in the prime of his youth at 26 years when his father died and he was entrusted with the management of an estate worth millions of £ sterling.</p>
<p>Young Charles, a devout Anglican, sought the hand of Catherine, the daughter of Lindamulage Jusey de Silva and Weerahennadi Weerabala Jayasuriya Patabendige Ana Fernando who were staunch Catholics. There was yet another suitor — a most eligible Karawa Catholic from Kalutara who rivalled his claim to Catherine’s hand. However, a compromise was made to solemnise the marriage according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Catherine is said to be the first in Moratuwa to wear a gown as her bridal attire.</p>
<p>At the wedding ceremony held at the bride’s residence, the ‘Chevalier Walawwa’ at Moratumulla, his father-in-law gave the couple a dowry of 7,500 Australian pounds. The young couple handed over the entirety of the dowry, to the groom’s paternal uncle Susew, who soon increased it to 10,000 Aus. by judicious investment.</p>
<p>His bride encouraged him and joined him in his numerous philanthropic activities. It was said that his marriage to Catherine brought him more wealth as a result of her ‘luck’ that she was bestowed with from her birth.</p>
<p>Their union begot 14 children — 7 boys and 7 girls with one son dying in his infancy.</p>
<p>It fell upon Catherine to look after the education and well-being of their large brood of children whilst at the same time playing perfect host to the people of all walks of life who called at the ‘Walawwa’ as their Moratuwa residence was known and also to the ‘Bagatalle Walawwa’. The latter was named ‘Alfred House’ in honour of the Royal visit of 22-4-1870.</p>
<p>Alfred House was a massive mansion and its garden extended 120 acres (0.49 km2).</p>
<p>When the coffee crash occurred even the European planters went back home. The wisdom of Charles in not depending on one crop enabled him not only to survive the coffee crisis, but also to increase his profits earned through coconut, cinnamon and real estate in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>It is said that he paid the Colombo Municipality a sum of Rs. 20,000 annually as taxes.</p>
<p>He started planting tea in the former coffee plantations of Hanguranketa and Maturata areas and soon his tea fetched record prices at the Colombo and London auctions. When he visited England in July 1886 he saw the produce from his estates filling most of the space in the warehouses of his agents Arbuthnot Lathan &amp; Co. of London.</p>
<p>Being a great philanthropist he recruited young locals, mostly his relations as Superintendents giving preference to those who have worked under the British in their plantations. The British always had their own kith and kin to run and manage their properties and often looked down upon the locals. But Charles de Soysa was able to beat them hollow at their own game.</p>
<p>In 1875, to commemorate the visit of H.R.H. the Prince and Princess of Wales, Charles decided to name the two schools he was building in Moratuwa in 15 acres (61,000 m2) of land between the Galle Road and the Lunawa Lagoon, ‘Prince of Wales’ and ‘Princess of Wales’.</p>
<p>Not only did he build these two institutions which soon became leading educational institutes in the island, he also paid the salaries of the teachers and other employees.</p>
<p>He and his wife always supported poor children in their educational activities by providing them with school fees, books and even clothes.</p>
<p>The magnanimity of this duo knew no bounds and nobody who approached them for assistance went away empty handed. His wife ran open house for visitors who called on them either at the Moratuwa or Begatalle Walawwas or the bungalows the De Soysas had in seven of the nine provinces in Ceylon whenever they were in residence.</p>
<p>The banquet he gave his Royal visitors is still talked of by old timers. The Royals were served in crockery and cutlery made of pure gold! Even in Buckingham Palace Royalty did not eat from gold plates!</p>
<p>The Royal reception was not only extravagant but also a great extravaganza where local craftsmen from the puppeteers, to the kolam and mask dancers entertained the Royals. There were short dramas mostly hilarious in nature the texts of which in English had been distributed prior to the staging. The prince and the party thoroughly enjoyed the local theatrics.</p>
<p>To commemorate the visit of the Duke of Edinburgh he renamed the Model Farm of 160 acres (0.65 km2) for agriculture and animal husbandry, as the Alfred Model Farm. Charles was a lover of animals; he had cattle imported from India and Ayrshire cattle from Australia. Each year he sent a team to India to purchase from Nellor cows for the model farm, his estates in Hanguranketa, Negombo and Puttalam areas.</p>
<p>He also had cattle, imported horses, Indian and Chinese gees, Turkeys, guinea fowls and ducks. A great lover of pets he had many a deer, ornamental birds — local and foreign and even elephants at his ‘Bagatalle Walawwa’. However, he did not have any dogs and it is indeed tragic that it was a stray dog infected with rabies that caused his death at the untimely age of 54.</p>
<p>He conducted research and experiments in the model farms to improve agricultural productivity. To convince his farmers he had residential facilities at Model Farm where the modern techniques in agriculture and animal husbandry were explained and demonstrated.</p>
<p>He was the first Ceylonese to get down agricultural seeds from tropical countries and certain European countries.</p>
<p>Charles also extended his patronage to literary projects as well. When his friend the Ven. Weligama Sri Sumangala Thero, High Priest of Pulinathalaramaya, Kalutara wrote the 3rd standard reader, he met the entire cost of printing and insisted that a copy should be sold only at the cost price of 39 1/2 cents per copy. Another noteworthy literary contribution of de Soysa was the printing and publication of the Sanskrit poem, ‘Janaki Haranaya’ — compiled by poet Kumaradasa. In spite of being a Christian de Soysa arranged these educational charities through the Ven. Ratmalane Sri Dharmarama Nayake Thero, the Chief Incumbent of the Vidyalankara Pirivena.</p>
<p>When he visited England in 1886 he saw the famous artefacts, including the ‘Yapahuwa Gate’ and other historical monuments on display at the Colonial and Indian exhibition. These he purchased and presented to the Royal institute.</p>
<p>Although Charles moved with kings he lived amongst the common people. Long before the Co-operative Movement officially got under way he sponsored the Moratuwa Carpenters’ Guild on co-operative lines. He also founded the Low Country Products Association. He along with other like minded leading citizens formed the ‘Moratuwa Association’ to spearhead the various social welfare activities of the town.</p>
<p>S. Thomas’ College, then at Mutwal was his alma mater although as the custom then with the elite, his early education was at the hands of resident teachers who were lavishly paid and well looked after even in their retirement with generous land grants etc. Even after their demise, their families were looked after. He donated a sum of Rs. 30,000 to S. Thomas’ College.</p>
<p>During that time, there were various forms of taxes that the people had to pay. One such tax was the ‘Poll Tax’ which could not be paid by the thousands of poor people in Moratuwa and they ran the risk of their properties being seized. Charles came to their rescue by paying the huge sums involved on behalf of all the townfolk.</p>
<p>He constructed roads and bridges in various parts of the country and the road from Galle Road to Lunawa and the bridge across the lagoon which serves the people to this day are mere drops in the ocean of the social welfare activities of Charles Henry De Soysa. Charles also constructed the Katubedda Road at Moratuwa and donated land to build the Lunawa Railway Station.</p>
<p>Even expatriates who were stranded in Ceylon for want of funds for their passage home were helped by him.</p>
<p>Perhaps his most noteworthy gift was the De Soysa Lying-in-Home — the maternity hospital at Borella which he also equipped with the modern machinery of the day. Whilst Charles de Soysa built and donated the De Soysa Lying-In-Home, his uncle late Mudliyar Susew de Soysa built and donated the ‘Medical Museum’ attached to the Medical College. These two institutions were declared open by the Governor Sir Robert Longdon on December 9, 1879.</p>
<p>His generosity was not confined to the Ceylonese. During his visit to England he donated large sums of money to British Medical Institutes such as Children’s hospitals, Women’s hospitals and Dock workers’ hospitals etc. Most of these charitable activities in England were channelled through his agents Arbuthnot Latham and Co. of London.</p>
<p>When Charles was in Kandy at his Harambe House in 1878 the Burmese envoy with his entourage paid a courtesy call on him. He arranged for valuable gifts to be sent to Burma and the Burmese envoy was full of praise for the Christian philanthropist who lavishly supported Buddhist causes.</p>
<p>The respect for De Soysa sprang not only from the townfolk — it was said that the ‘Robin Hood of Ceylon’ — Saradiel too had instructed his band of highway robbers not to rob goods belonging to the De Soysas as they did a great service to the poor people of the country. The cart-trains carrying goods to and from Colombo used to be waylaid by Saradiel and his men at Uthuwankanda in Mawanella.</p>
<p>Charles Henry de Soysa was bitten by a rabid dog that strayed into the Bagatalle Walawwa on August 2, 1890. It was originally decided to remove him to Paris for treatment. This decision was reversed due to various reasons and Charles himself opted to remain in Ceylon and obtain native treatment. He wanted to be taken to ‘Moratuwa Walawwa’ where he remained until he breathed his last.</p>
<p>Unlike most other people bitten by rabid dogs, Charles was fully rational until his last.</p>
<p>He called his children who were in the island at the time to his bedside and gave them his final word of advice.</p>
<p>‘There is nothing that you are in want of now. Respect all people and live humbly and virtuously. Do not have vehicles and houses more than you need. Transfer the office at Fort to the Walawwa at Moratuwa. Death is what everyone has to face. That eventually I too have to face now. None of you need to worry over it. What I said to you all, convey to my three sons who are in England. When I die bury my body at Holy Emmanuel Church cemetery, next to where my deceased son has been buried. I have nothing more to tell you!’.</p>
<p>He died peacefully in his sleep around 9.00 p.m. on 29th September 1890.</p>

<h3>The Mottos</h3>
<p>The original motto of the school was “ICH DIEN”. At the first Old Boys’ Dinner held in 1907, it was decided to use “NIHIL PER SALTUM” as a secondary motto. Prince of Wales’ College is the only school in Sri Lanka which has two mottos.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>ICH DIEN</h4>
<p>A German phrase which translates to “I Serve”.</p></li>
<li>
<h4>NIHIL PER SALTUM</h4>
<p>A Latin phrase which translates to “Step-by-Step”</p></li>

   <div class="entry-content">
<p>By the end of the 19th century, only a few schools in Sri Lanka offered higher education and most of them were limited to Colombo. The inception of Prince of Wales’ and Princess of Wales’ schools can be considered as a special reward to the children of Moratuwa area. The founder of the school was the great philanthropist, Sir Charles Henry De Soysa. Following the arrival of the then Prince of Wales (Edward VII) in Colombo in 1875, Sir Charles Henry De Soysa felt like naming the two schools he intended to build as Prince of Wales’ and Princess of Wales’. As a result of a letter sent on 27th of November 1875, he received permission to name the two schools as Prince of Wales’ and Princess of Wales’.</p>
<p>14th of September 1876 was a memorable day for the Moratuwa community; the school, which was built on a picturesque 15 acre land facing the Galle Road and bordered by the Lunawa lagoon, was ceremonially opened. The then governor of Sri Lanka, Sir William Gregory, graced the occasion as the Chief Guest.</p>
<p>The plan of the school was drawn by Mr. Muhandiram Mendis Jayawardena and about Rs. 300,000/= was spent on the construction of the school. This school building was one of the most elegant school buildings of the country in that era.</p>
<p>Sir Charles Henry De Soysa completed 5 school buildings at first (along with all the necessary equipment) and opened the school to the public. He also carefully looked over the administration, management and maintenance of the school till his death. In his last will, he requested that his eldest son take over the responsibilities of the school and also asked his wife to pay Rs. 3000/= to the school annually, for maintenance work.</p>
<p>Mr. W.S. Gunawardena (B.A. Calcutta) was the first principal of the school and served the school from 1876 till 1891. At first, this was not operated as one school, but as 4 educational institutes. That is,</p>
<ul>
<li>Prince of Wales’ College</li>
<li>Princess of Wales’ College</li>
<li>Prince of Wales’ College (native language)</li>
<li>Princess of Wales’ College (native language)</li>
</ul>
<p>There were only 40 teachers for all of the above mentioned schools.</p>
<p>The first prize giving of the school was held in 1883 with Sir John Douglas as the chief guest. There were prize records of all 4 schools in it. Prince of Wales’ College and Prince of Wales’ College (native) only had classes up to Grade 7. Prince of Wales’ College was the higher school and it had two divisions named Upper and Lower. Apart from this, there were 2 classes for undergraduates.</p>
<p>Satisfactory results were emerging from the school in no time. The school hostel was started in 1882 and cricket was also introduced to the school during this time.</p>
<p>On 29th of September 1890, the founder of the school, Sir Charles Henry De Soysa, passed away. Although the whole country and all of Moratuwa were grieving over this tragic loss, none of it was comparable to the grievance of Prince and Princess of Wales’ Colleges. In 1891, the first principal of the school, Mr. W.S. Gunawardena bid adieu to Prince of Wales’ College.</p>
<p>Mr. Philip Lewis became the second principal of the school and served the school from 1892 till 1896. Although amongst many difficulties, a rapid development of the school could be seen during this period. Mr. J.P.C. Mendis (B.A. Cambridge) rendered a valuable service to the school for two decades, from 1896 to 1917. During his reign a Cricket Society was formed in the school and the school ground was further developed. The school magazine: “The Cambrian”(first issued in 1897), Debating Team, Cadet Corps(1903), library, laboratory, Commerce Section, tennis and soccer teams, a kid’s park were some of the elements which were added to the school in this era. Another important milestone was the formation of the Old Boys’ Association (the best friend and an integral part of the school) in 1904. While the school was on its course for a rapid development, the number of students increased and the facilities were enhanced accordingly.</p>
<p>On 14th of September 1901, the 25th anniversary of the school was celebrated while the first Old Boys’ Dinner was held in 1907. On that day, the principal decided that purple, gold and maroon were suitable as school colours and it was also decided to use&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140911014550/file:///C:/Users/chamara/Desktop/New%20Site/Crest%20and%20Motto.htm">“Nihil Per Saltum”</a>&nbsp;as a secondary motto(the school already had a motto, “Ich Dien”). Because of this, Prince of Wales’ College became the only school to have two mottos.</p>
<p>After Mrs. De Soysa passed away, the seven sons of Sir Charles Henry De Soysa received the stewardship of the school. They also received their education from Prince of Wales’ College and their aid was vital for the school.</p>
<p>3rd of March was selected as the Founder’s Day. Students attended the service at the Emmanuel church and also paid respect to the tomb of Sir Charles Henry De Soysa. And since 1960s, Buddhist students have commemorated the Founder’s Day by engaging in Buddhist rituals.</p>
<p>After 21 years of service, Mr. Mendis had to retire from his post as Principal due to his bad health condition.</p>
<p>Mr. P.T. Jayasuriya [B.A. Hon.(Lond)] became the successor of Mr. Mendis. During his time at Prince of Wales’ College, the academic aspect of the school improved significantly, with students bringing up great results. Furthermore, the Science section and the school cricket ground were developed further and a separate kids’ park for the school was built. In 1922, “The Cambrian” was published again and the infrastructure of the school was also enhanced by adding 3 more class rooms. A house system was initiated and 4 houses were named, after the founder and the first three of the principals (namely, Founder’s, Gunawardena, Lewis, Mendis) and a sports meet was held on the Founder’s Day under these houses.</p>
<p>In 1926, Mr. L.E. Blaze (B.A. Cantab) was appointed as the principal. He was a very dynamic person and the Golden Jubilee Prize Giving was held in his period. The English College anthem was also created during this period.</p>
<p>Mr. L.G. Crease (M.A. Oxen) headed the school from 1927 to 1931. He was an European and was very strict when it came to student discipline. He was a competent administrator and there was a marked development in cadetting and sports.</p>
<p>Rev. F.R.E. Mendis (M.A. Cantab) served as the principal from 1931-1932. The separation of the native language school was a highlight during this period. Starting of a library fund, re-publishing “The Cambrian” after 10 years, re-organizing the houses, developing sports such as cricket, soccer, boxing, athletics were some of the notable achievements in this short period.</p>
<p>Mr. H. Samaranayake (B.A. ) who was appointed as the principal in 1932 was the first Buddhist principal. During this period, the standard and quality of academics and academic results were high.</p>
<p>The principal from 1933-1959, Mr. J.B.C. Rodrigo (M.A. J.P.U.M.), was a very capable administrator. Blessed with a great personality, he carried on his duties in an organized manner, even amongst many obstacles. Although 1939-40 was the time of the World War II, academics were of high standard. The school cricket ground was further developed through a massive&nbsp;<em>shramadaana</em>&nbsp;and was opened to the students in 1937. The pavilion was also developed. A few carnivals were held in order to raise the funds needed to develop the school. School cricket was brought on to a a whole new level and a Cricket Association was formed. Hockey was introduced to the school in 1938 and many other sports were developed. Apart from these, clubs and societies like The Teachers’ Guild, Cinema Association, Science Association, Drama Association, Red Cross branch, Sinhala and English Literary Associations, Debating Team, Co-operative Association were initiated for the benefit of the students. A few new buildings and class rooms were built and the College Main Hall was refurbished during this time.</p>
<p>In 1933, the inaugural Battle of the Golds (Prince of Wales’ College vs. St. Sebastian’s College) was held at the school ground.</p>
<p>In 1951, Prince and Princess of Wales’ Colleges celebrated the 75th anniversary of the 2 schools.</p>
<p>Another highlight during this time was the introduction of Free Education to the school on 1st of April in 1951.</p>
<p>Since the Founder’s Day in 1952, the memorial service was arranged to be held in Sinhala.</p>
<p>In order to appreciate the services rendered by Mr. J.B.C. Rodrigo during his 27 year reign(the longest reign ever in the school’s history), a special meeting was held on 5th of July in 1959.</p>
<p>Mr. S.C.H. De Silva (B.A., Dip. in School Admst) served the school for 14 years and there was a notable progression in the development of the school. The school, which was under the administration of the Soysa family, was taken under the administration of the government on the 15th of December in 1961. Badminton and Chess clubs were formed during this time along with the introduction of Scouting. For the first time in the history of the school, a Buddhist Association was formed in 1961 and a Buddhist monk, Hagoda Khemananda thero, joined the staff for the first time. Under his guidance, Amadyapa Adhumapa Sangamaya was initiated and construction of the school shrine began on 24th of October 1967. It was opened by the then Chief Governor, Mr. William Gopallawa. Christian Association was also started during Mr. Silva’s time as the principal and in 1964, a Christmas Carol Service was held and the magazine “Sisu Kithu Hada” was published.</p>
<p>The Sinhala college anthem was written by Mr. B. Godahewa in 1967 and it was sung at that year’s prize giving for the first time.</p>
<p>Mr. Tissa Gunawardena joined the Prince of Wales’ staff during this time. It was a blessing to have the services of an individual with expertise on fields ranging from art, sculpture to drama. Art Society and the Drama Club showed remarkable progress under his guidance. Mr. Gunawardena presented many stage plays, bringing out the hidden talents of the students.</p>
<p>A solid Parent-Teacher Association was formed during this period. The native language school(which was shifted to the Holy Emmanuel Church in 1965) was reunited with the school after the construction of two new buildings near the lagoon. Out of the students who were in the native language school, the 187 male students and the 5 teachers were taken in to Prince of Wales’ College while the 180 female students were taken in to Princess of Wales’ College.</p>
<p>According to the new education reforms in 1968, the primary school was started. Classes from grade 1 up to grade 7 belonged to this.</p>
<p>Mr. L. H. Gunapala (1973-1977), who had served as a school inspector and as a district education inspector previously, was the principal during the centennial anniversary of the school. Bringing back the official residence of the principal to school premises, carefully monitoring the discipline of the students, enhancing and repairing the school buildings and laboratories were some of the highlights during his time. Separate classrooms were allocated to Scouting, Social Studies, Eastern Music, Art, Christianity and Roman Catholicism. Apart from these a branch of the National Savings Bank was opened and the Hevisi and Western bands were formed during this time. Soon the school was amongst the top schools in the island. A new house (Rodrigo) was added and in 1975, a Sil observation programme was held for the first time. Sectional Heads were appointed to all sections from grade 4 to grade 12 and Teachers-in-Charge were appointed for the houses and main subjects.</p>
<p>Mr. M. E. C. Fernando (1977-1988) succeeded Mr. Gunapala as the principal. During his time, various novelties were added to the school. H. R. Fernando pavilion, cricket score board, library buildings, Science and Commerce buildings were some of these new additions. The sculpture of Sir Charles Henry De Soysa (sculpted by Mr. Tissa Gunawardena) was unveiled during this time. The venue of the annual Big Match was changed and was arranged to be held at Tyronne Fernando Stadium. The limited over encounter was also introduced during this era.</p>
<p>Mr. H.L.B. Gomes (M.A.), who was an old boy, a teacher and vice principal (during Mr. M. E. C. Fernando’s reign as principal), was appointed as the principal in 1989. In his time, the school became one of the 15 National Schools in Sri Lanka. The primary section was reopened during this time. Amongst other developments which were seen in the school during his reign are,</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction of computer technology to the school</li>
<li>Making a qualitative improvement in education</li>
<li>Expanding the school further by adding more facilities. Namely,
<ul>
<li>Three 3 storey buildings for Grade 11, Commerce section and the Primary.</li>
<li>The new auditorium with the latest facilities.</li>
<li>The canteens for students and teachers.</li>
<li>Initiating the construction of the new hostel.</li>
<li>Construction of the school office, Principal’s office, meeting hall and toilets.</li>
<li>Introduction of the Media Unit.</li>
<li>Constructing 2 playgrounds for the Primary, including a cricket ground.</li>
</ul>
</li>
